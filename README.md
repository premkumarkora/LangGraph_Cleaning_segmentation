# LangGraph Data Cleaning & Segmentation Pipeline

This repository implements an intelligent, agentic workflow using **LangGraph** to automate the process of data cleaning and customer/data segmentation. By leveraging a state-graph architecture, the system can handle complex, non-linear tasks such as outlier detection, missing value imputation, and automated clustering with LLM-driven decision-making.

## Overview

Traditional data pipelines are often rigid. This project uses **LangGraph** to create a cyclic, stateful workflow where an AI agent can:

1. **Analyze** the raw dataset schema and quality.
2. **Clean** the data dynamically (handling nulls, encoding, and scaling).
3. **Segment** the data using machine learning (e.g., K-Means or LLM-based categorization).
4. **Reflect** on the results and iterate if the quality doesn't meet specific thresholds.

## Architecture

The workflow is designed as a directed graph where each node represents a specific functional step:

* **Data Loader Node:** Imports CSV/Excel files and initializes the graph state.
* **Cleaning Agent:** Detects anomalies, handles missing values, and prepares features.
* **Segmentation Node:** Applies clustering algorithms or classification logic to group data points.
* **Evaluation Node:** Uses an LLM to interpret the clusters/segments and verify if the cleaning was successful.
* **Router:** Directs the flow based on data quality (e.g., "Back to cleaning" or "Proceed to Final Report").

## Component Implementation

#### Supervisor (`agents.py`)
- **LLM:** `gpt-4o-mini`
- **Routing Logic:** Uses a structured system prompt to decide the `next_node` based on the conversation history.
- **Robustness:** Implements Regex-based parsing (`detected_agent`) to handle "chatty" LLM responses, ensuring strict routing even if the LLM wraps the agent name in natural language.
- **Checklist Enforcement:** Explicitly programmed to verify that `Clustering` and `Visualization` have occurred before returning `FINISH`.

### Functional Agents (`agents.py`)
All agents (Cleaning, Clustering, Visualization) are `ReACT` agents built with `create_react_agent`.
- **Context Injection:** The `run_specialist` wrapper injects a specific `SystemMessage` containing the **Absolute Path** of the active CSV file before every invocation.
- **Recursion Management:** Agents operate with a local recursion limit of 50 to prevent infinite loops.
- **Hand-off Protocol:** Agents are instructed to "Finish their turn" and report "Task Complete" rather than asking the user for input, maintaining the autonomous chain.

### Tools (`tools.py`)
- **`clean_data`**:
  - Null Imputation: Median (numeric) / Mode (categorical).
  - Safe Outlier Removal: Uses IQR but guarantees retention of at least 10% of data or 5 rows.
  - Smart Paths: Handles absolute paths and prevents redundant filenames (e.g., `_cleaned_cleaned`).
  - Column Dropping: Accepts a `drop_columns` list to act on EDA findings.
- **`perform_eda`**:
  - Correlation Check: Identifies pairs with >0.85 correlation.
  - Suggestion Engine: Returns a specific list of `SUGGESTED DROPS` to the agent.
- **`perform_clustering`**:
  - Pipeline: `StandardScaler` -> `OneHotEncoder` -> `KMeans` -> `PCA` (2 components).
  - Output: Saves `_clustered.csv`.
- **`generate_visualization`**:
  - Validation: Checks for PCA columns.
  - Signalling: Returns a success message that triggers the Streamlit UI to render the chart.

#### State Management (`state.py`)
- **`AgentState`**: A TypedDict tracking:
  - `messages`: List of `BaseMessage` (User/AI/Tool).
  - `next_node`: The next agent to call.
  - `df_path`: The **Absolute Path** to the currently active CSV file.

### Persistence (`agents.py`)
- **`MemorySaver`**: Uses in-memory checkpointing to maintain graph state across steps within a single session.

### User Interface (`app.py`)
- **Streaming Trace:** Uses `trace_placeholder` to render real-time tool calls and arguments.
- **Agent Reports:** Filters the main chat stream to display nicely formatted Markdown reports (e.g., `### 🧹 Cleaning Report`) from agent summaries.
- **Dynamic File Handling:** 
  - Uses `os.path.abspath` for all file saves.
  - Updates `st.session_state.df_path` based on agent outputs.
- **Visualization:**
  - Detects `_clustered.csv` to render PCA scatter plots.
  - Detects `signals generated` to render EDA heatmaps.
- **Export:** Provides a `st.download_button` for the final processed dataset.

# Access cleaned data and segmentation labels
print(results["cleaned_data"])
print(results["segments"])

```
